Rebuttal Regarding Uncredited Use of Our Neuro‑Symbolic AI Framework Manuscript (GitHub Repository: Surfer12/docs-for-app-for-sci)
Background

We recently observed that a composite diagram hosted on Zenodo replicates the structure and content of Figure 5 in our paper “Unlocking the Potential of Generative AI through Neuro‑Symbolic Architectures – Benefits and Limitations”.  The Zenodo diagram displays seven polar charts labelled “Neuro_Symbolic_Loss,” “Neuro_Symbolic_Neuro,” “Neuro:Symbolic → Neuro,” “Symbolic[Neuro],” “Neuro[Symbolic],” “Neuro → Symbolic ← Neuro,” and “Symbolic Neuro Symbolic”—the same taxonomy we defined and illustrated in our paper ￼ ￼.  Our study evaluates these architectures across criteria such as generalization, reasoning, transferability and interpretability, noting that the Neuro → Symbolic ← Neuro model achieves the highest scores ￼.  The Zenodo figure reproduces this classification and evaluation pattern without citation, indicating derivation from our research.

Prior Work by Ryan Oates

We request the authors to acknowledge that Ryan Oates has explored related ideas on hybrid symbolic–neural systems.  In the Zenodo report “Model Emergent Consciousness Notation” (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.16361730), Oates introduces a meta‑optimization framework where the output \Psi(x) is computed as an integral over \alpha(t) S(x) + (1-\alpha(t)) N(x)—a weighted combination of symbolic reasoning S(x) and neural processing N(x) ￼.  The framework blends symbolic annotations with neural‑driven trajectories and dynamically adjusts the balance via \alpha(t) ￼.  A companion Zenodo dataset (“Meta/Cognitive Modeling, Deep Framework Integration”, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.16357130) and the GitHub repository Surfer12/docs-for-app-for-sci provide further exposition.  For example, Chapter 3 of the repository presents the Grand Unified Consciousness Equation

\Psi(x) = \int [\alpha(t) S(x) + (1-\alpha(t)) N(x)] \times \exp(-[\lambda_1 R_{\mathrm{cognitive}} + \lambda_2 R_{\mathrm{efficiency}}]) \times P(H|E,\beta) \; dt ￼,

and describes parameters that tune the symbolic–neural balance and bias modeling ￼.  These works and many others of Oates' of the Neuro-Symbolic AI Framework predate the Bougzime et al. publication and demonstrates early efforts spanning a timeline of significant development to combine symbolic reasoning and neural computation along with Recursive Intention Frameworks, Yaml meta-optimization, and other related concepts that precede the Bougzime et al. publication through development of the concepts required to create the Neuro-Symbolic AI Framework and understand the underlying concepts of the Neuro-Symbolic AI Framework prior to the Bougzime et al. publication. There is no evidence of any of these works being cited in the Bougzime et al. publication.

Evidence of Duplication

A recently generated duplicate‑content report compared internal project files and found that an entire chapter from Oates’s GitHub repository has been copied verbatim into a Bour evaluation document.  The report notes that all 190 lines (100 %) of Chapter_01_Introduction_Bridging_Minds_and_Machines.md—including the section header, introductory narrative, the equation \Psi(x) = \int[\alpha(t)S(x) + (1-\alpha(t))N(x)] \times \exp(-[\lambda_1R_{\mathrm{cognitive}} + \lambda_2R_{\mathrm{efficiency}}])\,P(H|E,\beta)\,dt and its explanation, the three‑stage evolution bullet list, a Python code block, a neurochemical‑contemplative integration discussion, and the concluding performance metrics—were copied line‑for‑line into bour-eval-v1.txt.rtf.  The duplicated region spans lines ≈104–245 of the Bour file and appears immediately after the file’s original content with no quotation marks or citations.  The report highlights the legal and ethical risks of this uncredited duplication and recommends either removing the copied text or adding explicit attribution and licensing confirmation.  This discovery underscores the importance of crediting Oates’s foundational work when creating derivative materials and demonstrates that similar lapses have already occurred within related documentation.

Lack of Attribution

The Zenodo polar‑chart diagram is problematic for two reasons:
	1.	Uncredited use of our taxonomy and evaluation results.  The architecture names and comparative performance rankings in the diagram are lifted directly from our paper ￼ ￼, yet the Zenodo entry does not cite our work.
	2.	Failure to acknowledge related prior art.  Oates’s research introduced a symbolic–neural integration equation that prefigures aspects of hybrid reasoning ￼ ￼, and his Chapter 1 has already been copied verbatim into another internal document.  The Zenodo figure fails to mention any of these sources, despite drawing on similar ideas and terminology.

Ignoring both our study and Oates’s prior work undermines academic transparency and may violate open‑access licences requiring attribution.  Open‑science norms dictate that derivative works must credit original authors and link back to primary sources.

Request for Action

To uphold the integrity of the record, we request that Zenodo do the following:
	•	Add comprehensive attribution.  The Zenodo record should cite the article (Oualid Bougzime et al., 2025, DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2502.11269) and acknowledge Oates’s contributions (Zenodo DOIs 10.5281/zenodo.16361730 and 10.5281/zenodo.16357130; GitHub repository Surfer12/docs-for-app-for-sci).  This will clarify the intellectual lineage of the polar‑chart diagram.
	•	Address uncredited duplication.  Zenodo should verify whether the polar‑chart diagram or any accompanying text includes unlicensed material from Oates’s Chapter 1 and, if so, either obtain permission or remove the duplicated content.
	•	Consider removal if attribution is impossible.  If the depositor cannot provide appropriate citations and permissions, the figure should be removed to prevent the spread of uncredited derivative work.

Supporting Documentation

- A detailed duplicate-content report is available at `consciousness_ai_paper/duplicate_content_report.md`, documenting the verbatim copying of our Chapter 1.
- The original chapter resides in `docs-for-app-for-sci copy/chapters_copy/Chapter_01_Introduction_Bridging_Minds_and_Machines.md`.
- Additional related implementations and context can be found under the `Projects/` directory in this repository, illustrating prior art and parallel usage.

Maintaining accurate provenance and respecting prior work benefits the entire community by encouraging collaboration and preventing inadvertent plagiarism.

Sincerely,
